### 2. Add Sample Products
Use the updated product form to add camera products with:
- Appropriate camera type (DSLR, Mirrorless, etc.)
- Correct sensor type (Full Frame, APS-C, etc.)
- Body color options (Black, Silver, etc.)

### 3. Update Existing Data (if any)
If you have existing products in the database:
- Update the `style` field to use camera types
- Update the `sizes` array to use sensor types
- Update the `colors` array to use appropriate body colors

### 4. Additional Enhancements (Optional)

Consider adding these camera-specific fields in the future:
- **Megapixels** - Resolution specification
- **ISO Range** - Light sensitivity range
- **Video Resolution** - 4K, 8K, etc.
- **Autofocus Points** - Number of AF points
- **Battery Life** - Shots per charge
- **Weather Sealing** - Yes/No
- **Brand** - Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, etc.
- **Warranty** - Warranty period and details

## Database Compatibility

The current implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- The `style` field is now used for camera type
- The `sizes` array is now used for sensor types
- The `colors` array is now used for body colors
- The `color` field still stores the primary color
- The `image` field still stores the primary image

No database migration is required - the same data structure is used.

## Summary

Your e-commerce platform has been successfully converted from a clothing marketplace to a camera marketplace. All admin panel forms now use camera-specific terminology and options. You can now start adding camera products and categories to build your camera marketplace!
