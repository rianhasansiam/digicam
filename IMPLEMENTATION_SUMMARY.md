## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### Before Going Live:

1. **Update Payment Numbers** (Line ~835-845 in CheckoutPageClient.js)
   ```javascript
   // Replace with your actual numbers:
   bKash: 01XXXXXXXXX  → Your real bKash number
   Nagad: 01XXXXXXXXX  → Your real Nagad number
   ```

2. **Verify ImageBB API Key** in `.env.local`
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEBB_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   ```

3. **Test Upload**: Try uploading a screenshot to ensure ImageBB works

4. **MongoDB**: Ensure database can handle new fields
