## Scan Results

### Files Modified: 4

1. **Footer.js** - Main footer content
2. **not-found.js** - 404 error page
3. **NavbarClient.js** - Navigation category icons
4. **SizeFilter.js** - Product filter comments

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Footer.js (`app/componets/footer/Footer.js`)

**Issue Found:**
```javascript
// ❌ OLD - Fashion/clothing reference
"We have clothes that suits your style and which you're proud to wear. 
From women to men."
```

**Fixed To:**
```javascript
// ✅ NEW - Camera equipment reference
"We have cameras and photography equipment that suit your needs and which 
you're proud to own. For professionals and enthusiasts alike."
```

**Impact:** Main footer description now correctly represents a camera store

### 2. not-found.js (`app/not-found.js`)

#### Change 1: Category URLs and Icons

**Fixed To:**
```javascript
// ✅ NEW - Camera categories with proper icons
DSLR Cameras:        📷  /allProducts?category=dslr

Accessories:         🎲  /allProducts?category=accessories

return '📷'; // Default camera icon
```

**Impact:** Dynamic category icons now show camera-related emojis instead of clothing emojis

---

### 4. SizeFilter.js (`app/(pages)/allProducts/components/SizeFilter.js`)

**Issue Found:**
```javascript
// ❌ OLD - Comment reference
// Custom sorting for clothing sizes
```

**Fixed To:**
