# 🔒 Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix - Blob URLs

## ❌ The Error

```
Refused to load the image 'blob:http://localhost:3000/7568c9e1-f10f-46a5-923c-872129c31dd1' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
"img-src 'self' https: data:".
```

---

## 🤔 What's Happening?

### Understanding the Components:

#### 1. **Blob URLs**
When you upload a file in the payment proof modal, JavaScript creates a temporary URL:
```javascript
const file = e.target.files[0];
const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);
// Creates: blob:http://localhost:3000/7568c9e1-f10f-46a5-923c-872129c31dd1
```

This is used to preview the image before uploading to ImageBB.

#### 2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
CSP is a security feature that controls what resources your website can load:
```
img-src 'self' https: data:
         ↓      ↓      ↓
      Same    HTTPS   Data
      origin  images  URIs
```

**Problem:** `blob:` URLs were NOT in the allowed list!

---

## 🔧 The Fix

### Updated CSP to Include `blob:`

#### Location 1: HTTP Headers (Line ~73)
**Before:**
```javascript
"img-src 'self' https: data:;"
```

**After:**
```javascript
"img-src 'self' https: data: blob:;"
                              ↑↑↑↑↑
                         Added blob:
```

#### Location 2: Image Config (Line ~47)
**Before:**
```javascript
contentSecurityPolicy: "...media-src 'self' data: blob:; object-src 'none'..."
```

**After:**
```javascript
contentSecurityPolicy: "...img-src 'self' https: data: blob:; media-src 'self' data: blob:..."
                                                     ↑↑↑↑↑
                                              Added blob: to img-src
```

## 📚 Understanding CSP Directives

### `img-src` - Controls Image Sources

| Directive | What It Allows | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `'self'` | Same origin images | `/images/logo.png` |
| `https:` | Any HTTPS image | `https://cdn.example.com/pic.jpg` |
| `data:` | Base64 images | `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...` |
| `blob:` | Blob URLs (file previews) | `blob:http://localhost:3000/abc123` |

### Why Each Is Needed:

```javascript
✅ 'self'   → Your own images in /public folder
✅ https:   → Images from ImageBB, Google, etc.
✅ data:    → Base64 encoded images
✅ blob:    → File upload previews (NEW!)
```

## 🖼️ How Blob URLs Are Used in Your App

### Payment Proof Modal Flow:

```javascript
// 1. User selects image file
<input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />

// 2. Create blob URL for preview
const file = e.target.files[0];
const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);
// Result: blob:http://localhost:3000/7568c9e1-f10f-46a5-923c-872129c31dd1

// 3. Set as preview
setPaymentProof(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  screenshot: file,              // Actual file (for upload)
  screenshotPreview: blobUrl     // Blob URL (for display)
}));

// 4. Display in <Image> component
<Image src={blobUrl} alt="Payment Screenshot" />
// ⚠️ This is where CSP was blocking it!

// 5. Later, upload actual file to ImageBB
const imageUrl = await uploadPaymentScreenshot(file);
// Returns: https://i.ibb.co/xyz/image.jpg
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Why CSP Exists:
CSP protects against:
- ❌ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ❌ Malicious image injections
- ❌ Unauthorized resource loading
- ❌ Data theft

### Is `blob:` Safe?
✅ **Yes!** Because:
- Blob URLs are temporary (browser session only)
- Created by YOUR JavaScript code
- Can't be injected from external sources
- Automatically cleaned up when page closes
- Only accessible within same origin

### Security Hierarchy:
```
Most Secure → Least Secure
   'self' > data: > blob: > https: > *
```

We allow all necessary ones for functionality while maintaining security.

---

## 🎯 What Each CSP Location Controls

### 1. HTTP Headers (`async headers()`)
- **Scope**: Entire application
- **Applied**: All pages, all requests
- **Purpose**: Site-wide security policy

### 2. Image Config (`contentSecurityPolicy`)
- **Scope**: Next.js Image component
- **Applied**: When using `next/image`
- **Purpose**: Image-specific policies

### Both Need to Allow `blob:` for Consistent Behavior

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Before Fix:
```
1. Upload image in payment modal
2. See file picker and select image
3. Console error: "Refused to load the image..."
4. Image preview doesn't show ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Upload image in payment modal
2. See file picker and select image
3. No console error ✅
4. Image preview shows immediately ✅
5. Can submit order successfully ✅
```

---

## 🔄 How to Test

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Restart dev server** (important for config changes):
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to checkout page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/checkout
   ```

3. **Fill in details and click "Pay 15%"**

4. **In payment proof modal**:
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select any image from your computer
   - **Should now see preview immediately!** ✅

5. **Check browser console**:
   - **No CSP errors** ✅
   - Image loads successfully ✅

## 📊 CSP Comparison

### Before (Blocked Blob URLs):
```javascript
Content-Security-Policy:
  img-src 'self' https: data:
          ✅    ✅     ✅    ❌ blob: (missing)
```

### After (Allows Blob URLs):
```javascript
Content-Security-Policy:
  img-src 'self' https: data: blob:
          ✅    ✅     ✅    ✅ (added!)
```

---

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

### `blob:` URLs Support:
✅ Chrome (all versions)
✅ Firefox (all versions)
✅ Safari (all versions)
✅ Edge (all versions)
✅ Mobile browsers

**Result:** Works everywhere! 🎉

---

## 💡 Other Places Blob URLs Might Be Used

In your app, blob URLs could appear in:

1. **File Upload Previews**
   - Payment screenshots ✅
   - Product images (admin)
   - Profile pictures
   - Any file input with preview

2. **Temporary Image Display**
   - Before upload to server
   - Image editing previews
   - Cropped image display

3. **Downloaded Files**
   - Generated reports
   - PDF previews
   - Downloaded images

All these now work with the CSP fix! ✅

## 🚨 Common CSP Errors & Solutions

### Error 1: Refused to load image (blob:)
**Solution:** Add `blob:` to `img-src` ✅ (Already fixed!)

### Error 2: Refused to load script
**Solution:** Add appropriate source to `script-src`

### Error 3: Refused to connect to API
**Solution:** Add API URL to `connect-src`

### Error 4: Refused to load font
**Solution:** Add source to `font-src`

## 📝 Complete CSP Breakdown

### Your Current Policy (After Fix):

```javascript
"default-src 'self';                    // Default: same origin only
 img-src 'self' https: data: blob:;     // Images: self, HTTPS, data, blob ✅
 script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https:;  // Scripts
 style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:;     // Styles
 font-src 'self' https: data:;          // Fonts
 connect-src 'self' https://api.imgbb.com https:;"  // API calls
```

### Each Part Explained:

| Directive | Your Settings | Why |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| `default-src 'self'` | Same origin | Default security |
| `img-src` | `'self' https: data: blob:` | All image types ✅ |
| `script-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https:` | React needs inline |
| `style-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline' https:` | Tailwind CSS |
| `font-src` | `'self' https: data:` | Web fonts |
| `connect-src` | `'self' https://api.imgbb.com https:` | API uploads |

## ✅ Summary

### Problem:
CSP blocked `blob:` URLs used for image preview in payment proof modal

### Root Cause:
`img-src` directive didn't include `blob:` in allowed sources

### Solution:
Added `blob:` to both CSP locations in `next.config.mjs`

### Result:
✅ Image preview works
✅ No CSP errors
✅ Upload flow complete
✅ Security maintained

---

## 🔄 After Applying Fix

### Required Action:
**Restart your development server!**

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then start again:
npm run dev
```

**Why?** `next.config.mjs` changes require server restart to take effect.

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After restarting:
1. ✅ No CSP errors in console
2. ✅ Image preview shows immediately
3. ✅ Can upload and submit payment proof
4. ✅ Order completes successfully
5. ✅ Security policy still active and protecting your app

---

**Fix Applied**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Action Required**: Restart dev server
**Security Impact**: None - blob: URLs are safe for file previews
