# ✅ Reviews Fetching - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem

Reviews were saved to database but not showing in UI.

```
Database: ✓ Has reviews
Admin Panel: ✗ Shows empty
Homepage: ✗ Shows empty
```

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

**Data schema mismatch:**

```javascript
// Database has:
{ userName, userEmail, isApproved: true/false }

// Code expected:
{ customerName, customerEmail, status: 'approved'/'pending' }

// Result: Data couldn't be displayed
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

Updated `normalizeReview` function to match database structure:

```javascript
// ✅ NEW - Maps both old and new fields
{
  userName: review.userName || review.customerName,
  userEmail: review.userEmail || review.customerEmail,
  userId: review.userId,
  isApproved: review.isApproved === true,
  status: review.isApproved ? 'approved' : 'pending',
  customer: {
    name: review.userName || 'Anonymous',
    email: review.userEmail || ''
  }
}
```

## 📊 Field Mapping

| Database | Normalized | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `userName` | `userName`, `customer.name` | Both formats |
| `userEmail` | `userEmail`, `customer.email` | Both formats |
| `userId` | `userId` | NEW |
| `isApproved` | `isApproved`, `status` | Boolean → String |
